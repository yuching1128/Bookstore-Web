# Online Bookstore Web
### Introduction
This is a hardening and RESTful online bookstore application. 
The frontend of the web application is built using the Vue framework, and the backend uses mySQL. 
It makes use of the Tomcat server and uses Ajax to update the website's content. 
The web application organizes the contents of the shopping cart using Vuex state management. 
You can purchase books using the online app for the bookshop by adding them to your shopping basket and then checking out. 
Information about the customer, including name, address, phone number, and email, is requested on the checkout page. 
Through Vuelidate and server side validation, the data would be verified according to its format. 
The client and order information would be entered into the database and the shopping cart would be cleared when pressing the complete purchase button.
